1,"The text can range from containing a single level of meaning to multiple levels of meaning based on complexity. Compared to grades 9-10, texts for grades 6-8 are less complex in this aspect.","A text with low complexity tends to have simple, well-marked, and conventional structures, whereas a text of high complexity tends to have complex, implicit, and unconventional structures. Simple texts tend to relate events in chronological order, while complex texts make more frequent use of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and other manipulations of time and sequence. Compared to grades 9-10, texts for grades 6-8 are less complex in this aspect.","That text that has longer words and longer sentences are more difficult to read than shorter ones. A text with many long words and/or sentences is thus rated by these formulas as harder to read than a text with many short words and/or sentences would be. Compared to grades 9-10, texts for grades 6-8 are less complex in this aspect.",Little Women by Louisa May Alcott,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain,The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost
